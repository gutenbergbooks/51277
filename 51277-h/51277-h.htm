<hr class="chap" />

<p>These poems were written,&mdash;except No. III.,
which was partly written two or three weeks
earlier,&mdash;during a stay of six weeks, in August
and September, at Hallstatt, among the mountains
of Upper Austria.</p>

<p>They are published at once, not because I
am unaware of their defects, but in the hope
that, in spite of these, they may give some small
pleasure to a few friends and other readers.</p>

<span class="i0">Thy whispers float upon the liquid air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sunbeams quiver by thy breath made quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The myriad forest-branches thronging thick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrill with delight thy mystic touch to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an enchanted harp to fingers fair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yielding a music that can soothe the sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or heal a heart that cruel pain doth prick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waters and winds thy living spirit share;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy wrath is in the thunder, and thy tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep for man's dulness in melodious rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mistress, forgive me if on deafened ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of life's clamour and its harsh refrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy words have fallen all these barren years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take me for thy minister again.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Proudly the glad ships breast the buoyant wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Touched by the radiant fingers of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting in the promise of dawn, and brave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Over the deep their unknown race to run,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From nothingness that none remembereth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">On to the undiscovered haven of death.<br /></span>
</div><br  /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of the impenetrable night they drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mist-curtained, moving darkly through the haze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the East brightened and the breezes blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And o'er life's widening waters now they gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Greet the companions of their voyage, and know<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Some dim awakening purpose in them grow.<br /></span>
</div><br  /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lightly they sail beneath unclouded skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Effortless gliding on their easy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the winds gather and the wild floods rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tempests frown upon the forehead of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And they that fared together lonelier drift,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sundered by driving storms and tides that shift.<br /></span>
</div><br  /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quenched are the beacon lights that brightly burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Distant the guiding voices that were near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frolic temper of the prime is turned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To weariness, and faith is dimmed with fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What if one battle against the beating waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who knows if he shall win the haven he craves?<br /></span>
</div><br  /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where lies the haven, or if there be in sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some haven of peace for them that wrestle and fight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall be bold to take his trust for truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The gleams he follows for the world's one light,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When to his fellows' eyes as naught they seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or but false phantoms of a fading dream?<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This way or that on waves that rise and fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Falling and rising aimlessly they drive&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply some flash of light, some far-off call<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wakes them a little while to struggle and strive<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Onward with hope, until it fades again,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And leaves them drifting on the dreary main.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blindly the many drift, and drifting dream,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dream idle dreams, or waking scarce descry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aught but the froth and foam and fitful gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of clashing cataracts as they thunder by:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They feel some short-lived passion in them glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or wondering watch the bubbles come and go.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And here is one undauntedly that steers&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or there another&mdash;steadfast through the surge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through storm and darkness. What is that which cheers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His spirit in danger? what beyond the verge<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of vision leads him on his perilous path?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sure naught but God's own truth such following hath.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Faint the gleams flicker through the earthborn cloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Trust thou and follow where they seem to lead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon will thy sight be clearer, and the shroud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of night be shrivelled, and the day succeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Light may be stained or hidden, yet 'tis light;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Trust thou and follow&mdash;'tis not of the night.<br /></span>

ON RE-READING 'RUTH.'</h2>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As one that in the sapless winter of life<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Feels the benumbing touch of icy death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chill his warm pulses, and no more for strife<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the foe that ever followeth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Finds the old fire within, or power, or breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knows that soon the eternal frost shall bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These failing organs of his earthly mind:<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And looking backward through the misty years<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beyond the harvest and the summer glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into awakening life's fresh springtide, hears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Voices that rang around him long ago,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Strange sweet dream-music that he seems to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dimly sees old faces that made bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days of childhood with love's softest light:<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Like one beneath the glimmering starlight treading<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ways unfamiliar save in the full sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He moves bewildered where remembrance, shedding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Faint fitful gleams, illumines one by one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far-distant scenes where life was first begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick with light-hearted fancies and fresh hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearless and steadfast with all foes to cope:<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as he looks he wonders if indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That life beyond the years be truly his&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His those high-soaring hopes, that simple creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That buoyant spirit: till some light that is<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The lode-star of his life shines out in this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-off child-world, some goal whereto his aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has aye been set unchangingly the same.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so to eyes that through long-buried ages<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Look on that alien-seeming world, that glows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pictured in fire upon the sacred pages<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where God his dealings with his children shows,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A larger life than our dwarfed spirit knows,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man in the giant vigour of his prime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looming heroic even through guilt and crime;<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Creature in converse with Creator,&mdash;signs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of power writ large in heaven and on the earth,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillar of cloud by day and fire that shines<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In darkness,&mdash;plague and pestilence and dearth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And deluge,&mdash;almost from our very birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar,&mdash;yet how strange and far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the fever of our little day.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet as we look on that mysterious story,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Scarce feeling kinship with that primal race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We that with sin have marred and dimmed the glory<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of God's own presence manifest by grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until he seems to hide afar his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find something in our deadened hearts that rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Responsive to those far-off echoings.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ours the old war with sin, the struggle of soul<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In passions' eddying waters, ours the choice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To falter and fail, or battle towards the goal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unyielding; and at times our hearts rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When borne from out the distance comes a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brother-men that in the self-same strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have fought through weakness and have won their life.<br /></span>
</div><br /><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And more than all, when haply shines above<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The clouds and heavy mists of low desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The perfect beauty of true human love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beaconing through the darkness like a fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And witnessing that hearts can yet aspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kinship with the soul that shone in Ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woman's faithfulness and woman's truth.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her eyes shone bright as the luminous star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That breaks through the shadows of dusk from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wavy tresses that floated and gleamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guarding her radiant temples, seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the faery fires that a vision enfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or light as the tremulous flames of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That quiver and glance on the forehead of dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the curtains of night are backward drawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her smile was like to the rippling sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greeting the beams of the sun with glee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her voice was the singing of springtide, heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the orison chanted by soaring bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the breath of the soft west breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wooing the buds of the wakened trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the music of fountains free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last from their icy slavery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she moved with a step as light and glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever a nymph or a goddess had.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Could mortal eyes on a form divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze for a moment, and then not pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With passionate hunger for that sweet food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the beauteous blossom of maidenhood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed for ever on that soft light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That conquered the gloom of the world's dark night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shed in its lustre a mystic sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soothing solace and joy intense?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Could ears drink once of the silver flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of melody poured from her lips, nor know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thirst of a madman, rendering up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life for the pleasure of one sweet cup?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Seeing and hearing, he scarce wist first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What light on his sunless path had burst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he felt about him a wondrous glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flooding the field of his vision, so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the shadows shrank as in shame away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hope rekindled her flickering ray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over his spirit seemed to flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quickening influence, even as though,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the heavy and poisoned air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some dark city, a God might bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One that struggled with labouring breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All but held in the grasp of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And might set him high on the aery brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a loftily-bastioned Alp, to drink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strength of the mountains&mdash;a stronger draught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ever of vintage fire was quaffed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coursing exultantly through and through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His veins, and giving him life anew.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So awhile he rejoiced, scarce heedful why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the days went sweetly and swiftly by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! too swiftly over and lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like blossoms of summer seared by the frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That feel more bitter the wintry spite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of the fulness of past delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Twas but a parting, and oft before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parting of friends, though his heart was sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parting and loss he had known to bear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis a lesson we learn from our cradle to share:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a sudden anguish upon him fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As upon one cast from heaven to hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a moment showed what had lifted his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the weary and sordid strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men that struggle and die for gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sell themselves as a chattel is sold.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And lo! it was over, and life once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must sink to the depth where it groped before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To part;&mdash;and it might be, never again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know the joy of her presence; fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was his heart to utter its secret woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the strength of its love to show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure 'twas a strength that must prevail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win the world, or the heavens to scale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High above earth she seemed, yet heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is mingled with earth by love's sweet leaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even the goddess of dawn, 'tis said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deign&egrave;d a mortal man to wed.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yet when he looked on the light divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seemed in those lustrous orbs to shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lips would falter, and pale shame froze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fountain of love from his heart that rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could a spirit as free as air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brook to be fettered, or stoop to share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An earthlier life from her range sublime?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the fancy he deemed a crime,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if one dreamt to win for his own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen of night from her star-girt throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And enjoy the light of the world alone,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What if he spake could she feel or say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Words of scorn? or of anger? Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity belike for a mind distraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rashly to soar from its sphere had sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harder were pity to bear than scorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to hide how his heart was torn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So might the thought of that sweet time be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever a cloudless memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of a day that from break to close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never a film on its bright face shows.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And so she was gone from his life, and left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart of joy and of light bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tenanted only by blank despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That finds no longer the sunshine fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows no healing for its distress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except to pass into nothingness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but a word and the tale is o'er,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haply the like has chanced before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it wants not this poor art of mine,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he sought as his sorrow's anodyne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood-red riot of war, to sate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thought with the numbing opiate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the frenzy of battle; and gave his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a prodigal gives, in an alien strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under the shroud of the desert sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lies at rest in a far-off land.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And one there is that for many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath mourned with many a secret tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light of her eyes is dimmed with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And age has silvered her sunny hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hollower rings the full rich flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her voice; and her step is weary and slow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little, I ween, is understood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tale of her maiden-widowhood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naught of her trouble of soul she saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever beyond the river of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothed as she draws to its margin nigher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looks to the haven of her desire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dimly her gaze through the mist descries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One that waiteth with earthward eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired by a deathless love whose glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke to her heart long years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When his lips were sealed and he thought her higher<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Coward lips!) than he durst aspire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she hid in her woman's pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love for which she had gladly died.<br /></span>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
